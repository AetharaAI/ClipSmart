## 📊 Expected Outcomes

### If Quality Score 90-95 (Excellent):
✅ ClipSmart works out of the box  
✅ M2 integration functional  
✅ All 3 splice modes operational  
✅ Export produces TikTok-ready videos  
✅ Deploy immediately with confidence  

**Action:** Deploy to production, start marketing!

### If Quality Score 80-89 (Good):
⚠️ Minor issues (missing tests, incomplete docs)  
⚠️ Core functionality works  
⚠️ Some edge cases not handled  

**Action:** Fix specific gaps using focused M2 prompts, then deploy.

### If Quality Score 70-79 (Acceptable):
❌ Several components missing or broken  
❌ M2 integration needs debugging  
❌ UI/UX rough around edges  

**Action:** Major iteration needed. Use checklist to identify gaps, create focused prompts for each missing piece.

### If Quality Score <70 (Needs Work):
🚫 Critical functionality missing  
🚫 App doesn't start or crashes  
🚫 M2 misunderstood requirements  

**Action:** Review prompt with M2 agent, paste error logs, request specific fixes. May need to re-run with clarified instructions.

## 🎯 Critical Success Factors

### Must-Haves for Launch:
1. ✅ Video upload working (local + YouTube URL)
2. ✅ M2 extracts clips with attention scores
3. ✅ Splice editor generates split-screen videos
4. ✅ Export to 720x1280 MP4 format
5. ✅ User library saves clips to Supabase
6. ✅ Docker Compose starts all services
7. ✅ README with setup instructions
8. ✅ No critical security vulnerabilities

### Nice-to-Haves (Can Add Later):
- 🌟 All 3 splice modes (can launch with 1)
- 🌟 Text overlay editor (manual workaround possible)
- 🌟 Auto-generated voiceovers (M2 feature, not core)
- 🌟 Direct TikTok upload (can do manually)
- 🌟 80%+ test coverage (can add incrementally)

## 🆘 Troubleshooting Resources

### If M2 Output is Incomplete:
1. Check **Quality Checklist** - which sections scored low?
2. Create focused prompts for missing components:
   ```
   "Generate complete MiniMax-M2 integration service for ClipSmart
   including: [list specific missing features from checklist]"
   ```
3. Paste M2's error logs back to me (Claude) for debugging

### If Setup Fails:
1. Check **Quick Start Guide Step 6** (Troubleshooting)
2. Verify all API keys are correct in .env
3. Check Docker logs: `docker-compose logs`
4. Ensure ports 3000, 8000, 5432, 6379 are free
5. Paste error logs to me (Claude) with environment details

### If Tests Fail:
1. Run individual test suites to isolate issue:
   ```bash
   npm test VideoPlayer.test.tsx  # Frontend
   pytest tests/test_m2_integration.py  # Backend
   ```
2. Check if issue is M2 API (test with mock data)
3. Verify FFmpeg and OpenCV installed correctly
4. Check disk space (video processing needs 5GB+ free)

### If Video Processing Fails:
1. Test FFmpeg directly: `ffmpeg -version`
2. Check Celery worker logs: `docker-compose logs clipsmart-celery`
3. Verify input video format (should be MP4, MOV, AVI, WebM)
4. Check if M2 API quota exceeded (rate limiting)
5. Try with smaller video first (<100MB, <5min)
